This is my solution to Build a Space Exploration Site lesson from The Frontend Developer Career Path that can be found on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

## What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned the following:

In the future, I would like to make this project more personal. Here is a list of things I want to change in the future:
